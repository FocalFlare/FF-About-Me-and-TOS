### Introduction

> What is good y'all, <big>itzzFocalFlare</big>, or Focal, Flare, Tommy Wolfox [which isn't my real/legal name by the way], or whatever the...
> 
> ```F U C K```
>
> ...you wanna call me.
>
>
> For those of you who know me personally, I ask you to **please refrain from using my real/legal name as that stays private**. Again, you can call me whatever so long that it's not racist or derogatory, but do not call me by my name IRL, even if you may be a family member or a relative of mine.

### About Me

> I'm Afro-Irish Native American  (yes I'm black and Irish so excuse my word usage) living in the US, and I'm [age = current year - 2002].
>
> I'm a cisgender male so my pronouns are he/him. However, I won't snap at you if you don't know my gender or pronouns, so when in doubt, refer to me either by my names or they/them.
>
> My sexual orientations are LGBTQ+ ally and asexual. I know that might not make sense to some of yall, but I have a tweet explaining it.

### What I Do

> I'm an SFW multimedia content creator (no nu#### or s## media), so I make almost all sorts of media under the broad SFW category in mediums such as videos, music, and art.
>
> I have two ongoing series of media. For music, I've established something called The PIX where I showcase within playlists some of the music that I liked. the most-active series is the Yearly PIX series where I compile playlists of 25 tracks that I think were the best of each year. For videos, I have a crap ton of gaming clips that I've taken within the past years, and I'm putting them in multiple compilation videos of 100 clips.

### Time Zone Comparison

> Don't snap at me if I'm "too early or too late" to something because it took place at a time different from mine according to my time zone:
>
>> * 12:00 AM [CT] (central time)
>
> By the way, whenever I say CT/central time, in my words, I'm referring to **central North American time** and not **central European time** (CT, not CET), so my 12:00a CT is different from whatever time it may be for you in CET. I've had some people get the two mixed up, so I'd just like to make that reminder!

# Trademarks

* `Loud = Funni`™️
